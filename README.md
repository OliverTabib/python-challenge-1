# python-challenge-1
This challenge is about adding to provided code that displays a grocery store within the console. The coder is required to handle user inputs and do basic coding tasks such as: if else, casting, iterations, input validation, error handling, documentation etc. 

The goal of this challenge is to explore data structures such as lists and dictionaries, which we learned about during our lectures.
